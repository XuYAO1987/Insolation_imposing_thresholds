# Insolation_imposing_thresholds
We provide Python code for generating dynamic visualizations of the insolation series (65 North Laskar 2004 solution for the past 10 million years) across threshold continua, alongside simulated rank and couplet time series as well as their cross-spectrum coherence and phase at 405-kyr periodicities
